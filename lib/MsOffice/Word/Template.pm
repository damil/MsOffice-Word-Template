=head1 NAME

MsOffice::Word::Template - generate Microsoft Word documents from Word templates

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $template = MsOffice::Word::Template->new($filename);
  my $new_doc  = $template->process(\%data);
  $new_doc->save_as($path_for_new_doc);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Purpose

This module treats a Microsoft Word document as a template for generating other documents. The idea is
similar to the "mail merge" functionality in Word, but with much richer possibilities, because the
whole power of a Perl templating engine can be exploited, for example for

=over

=item *

dealing with complex, nested datastructures

=item *

using control directives for loops, conditionals, subroutines, etc.

=back


Template authors just have to use the highlighing function in MsWord to
mark the templating directives :

=over

=item *

fragments highlighted in B<yelllow> are interpreted as I<data>
directives, i.e. the template result will be inserted at that point in
the document, keeping the current formatting properties (bold, italic,
font, etc.).

=item *

fragments highlighted in B<green> are interpreted as I<control>
directives that do not directly generate content, like loops, conditionals,
etc. Paragraphs or table rows around such directives are dismissed,
in order to avoid empty paragraphs or empty rows in the resulting document.

=back

The syntax of data and control directives depends on the backend
templating engine.  The default engine is the L<Perl Template
Toolkit|Template>; other engines can be specified through parameters
to the L</new> method -- see the L</TEMPLATE ENGINE> section below.


=head2 Status

This first release is a proof of concept. Some simple templates have
been successfully tried; however it is likely that a number of
improvements will have to be made before this system can be used at
large scale in production.  If you use this module, please keep me
informed of your difficulties, tricks, suggestions, etc.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $template = MsOffice::Word::Template->new($docx);
  # or : my $template = MsOffice::Word::Template->new($surgeon);   # an instance of MsOffice::Word::Surgeon
  # or : my $template = MsOffice::Word::Template->new(docx => $docx, %options);

In its simplest form, the constructor takes a single argument which
is either a string (path to a F<docx> document), or an instance of
L<MsOffice::Word::Surgeon>. Otherwise the constructor takes a list of named parameters,
which can be


=over

=item docx

path to a MsWord document in F<docx> format. This will automatically create
an instance of L<MsOffice::Word::Surgeon> and pass it to the constructor
through the C<surgeon> keyword.

=item surgeon

an instance of L<MsOffice::Word::Surgeon>. This is a mandatory parameter, either
directly through the C<surgeon> keyword, or indirectly through the C<docx> keyword.

=item data_color

the Word highlight color for marking data directives (default : yellow)

=item control_color

the Word highlight color for marking control directives (default : green).
Such directives should produce no content. They are treated outside of the regular text flow.

=back

In addition to the attributes above, other attributes can be passed to the
constructor for specifying a templating engine different from the 
default L<Perl Template Toolkit|Template>.
These are described in section L</TEMPLATE ENGINE> below.


=head2 process

  my $new_doc = $template->process(\%data);
  $new_doc->save_as($path_for_new_doc);

Process the template on a given data tree, and return a new document
(actually, a new instance of L<MsOffice::Word::Surgeon>).
That document can then be saved  using L<MsOffice::Word::Surgeon/save_as>.


=head1 AUTHORING TEMPLATES

A template is just a regular Word document, in which the highlighted
fragments represent templating directives.

The data directives, i.e. the "holes" to be filled must be highlighted
in B<yellow>. Such zones must contain the names of variables to fill the
holes. If the template engine supports it, names of variables can be paths
into a complex datastructure, with dots separating the levels, like
C<foo.3.bar.-1> -- see L<Template::Manual::Directive/GET> and
L<Template::Manual::Variables> if you are using the Template Toolkit.

Control directives like C<IF>, C<FOREACH>, etc. must be highlighted in
B<green>. When seeing a green zone, the system will remove markup for
the surrounding XML nodes (text, run and paragraph nodes). If this
occurs within a table, the markup for the current row is also
removed. This mechanism ensures that the final result will not contain
empty paragraphs or empty rows at places corresponding to control directives.

In consequence of this distinction between yellow and green
highlights, templating zones cannot mix data directives with control
directives : a data directive within a green zone would generate output
outside of the regular XML flow (paragraph nodes, run nodes and text
nodes), and therefore MsWord would generate an error when trying to
open such content. There is a workaround, however : data directives
within a green zone will work if they I<also generate the appropriate markup>
for paragraph nodes, run nodes and text nodes; but in that case you must
also apply the "none" filter from L<Template::AutoFilter> so that
angle brackets in XML markup do not get translated into HTML entities.


=head1 TEMPLATE ENGINE

This module invokes a backend I<templating engine> for interpreting the
template directives. In order to use an engine different from the default
L<Template Toolkit|Template>, you must supply the following parameters
to the L</new> method :

=over

=item start_tag

The string for identifying the start of a template directive

=item end_tag

The string for identifying the end of a template directive

=item engine

A reference to a method that will perform the templating operation (explained below)

=item engine_args

An optional list of parameters that may be used by the engine

=back

Given a datatree in C<$vars>, the engine will be called as :

  my $engine  = $self->engine;
  my $new_XML = $self->$engine($vars);

It is up to the engine method to exploit C<< $self->engine_args >> if needed.

If the engine is called repetively, it may need to store some data to be
persistent between two calls, like for example a compiled version of the
parsed template. To this end, there is an internal hashref attribute
called C<engine_stash>. If necessary the stash can be cleared through
the C<clear_stash> method.

Here is an example using L<Template::Mustache> :

  my $template = MsOffice::Word::Template->new(
    docx      => $template_file,
    start_tag => "{{",
    end_tag   => "}}",
    engine    => sub {
      my ($self, $vars) = @_;

      # at the first invocation, create a Mustache compiled template and store it in the stash.
      # Further invocations will just reuse the object in stash.
      my $stash            = $self->{engine_stash} //= {};
      $stash->{mustache} //= Template::Mustache->new(
        template => $self->{template_text},
        @{$self->engine_args},   # for ex. partials, partial_path, context
                                 # -- see L<Template::Mustache> documentation
       );

      # generate new XML by invoking the template on $vars
      my $new_XML = $stash->{mustache}->render($vars);

      return $new_XML;
      },
   );

The engine must make sure that ampersand characters and angle brackets
are automatically replaced by the corresponding HTML entities
(otherwise the resulting XML would be incorrect and could not be
opened by Microsoft Word).  The Mustache engine does this
automatically.  The Template Toolkit would normally require to
explicitly add an C<html> filter at each directive :

  [% foo.bar | html %]

but thanks to the L<Template::AutoFilter>
module, this is performed automatically.


=head1 TEMPLATE AUTHORING WITH TEMPLATE TOOLKIT

This chapter just gives a few hints for authoring Word templates with the
Template Toolkit.

The examples below use [[segments in double square brackets]] to indicate
segments that should be highlighted in B<green> within the Word template.


=head2 Bookmarks

The Template Toolkit is instantiated with a predefined wrapper for generating
Word bookmarks. Within the Word Template, write something like

   Here is a paragraph with [[WRAPPER bookmark name="my_bookmark"]]bookmarked text[[END]].

Beware that Word is quite restrictive on bookmark names : they cannot exceed 40 Unicode
characters, must not start with a digit and must not contain any kind of white space or
punctuation.

=head2 Internal hyperlinks

Similarly, there is a predefined wrapper for generating
hyperlinks to bookmarks. Within the Word Template, write something like

   Click [[WRAPPER link_to_bookmark name="my_bookmark"]]here[[END]].
